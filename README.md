#Instructions to run the program:

    Clone the project from: https://github.com/gdimitriou/rnn-text-classification.git
    Import it to your favorite IDE
    Download the dependencies
    Download the embeddings from: 
        1. https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
        2. 
    Run the text-classifier.py

#Expecting output:
    The model predicts a probability for each 
    The output should look like sample_submission.txt
